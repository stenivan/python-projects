Hello!

This repository is where I'll post my python projects ranging from simple games and any other interesting applications or tutorials that I'm learning.

- Milestone Project I - Tic Tac Toe Game, based on Udemy's Python Zero to Hero python programming course. 
- Milestone Project II - Blackjack Game, based on Udemy's Python Zero to Hero python programming course.  

This repo is a work in progress.

Thanks!
